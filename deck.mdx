<Quote credit='David Bowie (1999)'>

I don't think we've even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the Internet is going to do to society both good and bad is unimaginable. I think we're on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying.

We want to understand the path we took to get to today. With that knowledge we want to understand where we are. My motivation: did this with three generations of ES.

---

Early Websites were simple documents.

(Super simple Website demo)

---

Slowly we gained styling.

90s hype

---

More functionality came to websites.

First were Java Applets.

JS was born and Flash.

---

Functionality moved more and more to the frontend.

---

Slowly bundling tools got important because massive JS needed to be organized into multiple files. That needed to be "bundled" for the browser.

---

Module systems started to appear.

---

Build tools take over more and more. That lays the groundwork for React, etc.

---

Somewhere in-between SASS and similar arise.

---

Today we are moving into a stable phawse of web-development with established tools, ecosystems and standards.
